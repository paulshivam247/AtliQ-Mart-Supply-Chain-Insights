AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer, is facing a critical challengeâ€”key customers are not renewing their contracts due to service issues. Late and incomplete deliveries have impacted customer satisfaction, highlighting the need for better supply chain tracking.  

As a **Data Analyst** in AtliQ Martâ€™s supply chain team, I built a **Power BI dashboard** to monitor:  

âœ… **On-Time Delivery (OT%)**  
âœ… **In-Full Delivery (IF%)**  
âœ… **On-Time In-Full (OTIF%)**  
âœ… **Line Fill Rate (LIFR%)**  
âœ… **Volume Fill Rate (VOFR%)**  

This dashboard provides **real-time insights** into customer service levels, helping the team take **proactive measures** to improve performance and rebuild customer trust before expanding to new markets.  

ðŸ“Œ **Key Learnings from this Project:**  
ðŸ”¹ Gained a deeper understanding of supply chain metrics and their impact  
ðŸ”¹ Applied **DAX functions** to derive meaningful insights  
ðŸ”¹ Designed a **story-driven dashboard** to make data-driven decisions actionable  
ðŸ”¹ Used conditional formatting to highlight key problem areas  

Check out the dashboard and let me know your thoughts! Your feedback is always welcome. ðŸš€
